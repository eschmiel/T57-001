		<h2>WHAT IS T57-001?</h2>
		<div class="double-underline"></div>
		<p>T57-001 is an unfinished visual novel prototype made in 2 weeks for the Emotional Mech Jam. It was made by Kirk Musngi, Tyler Rhodes and Eric Schmiel.
		<br><br>
		The game takes place in the aftermath of a devastating period of total warfare. 40 years have passed and much of the world has moved on. Old enemies have become
		trading partners and whole generations have grown up with no living memory of the conflict. But there
		are still some left that lived through it, and although they have done their best to move on with their children, they still remember.
		<br><br>
		Our story follows an old man who piloted a mech during the conflict. In the post-war years, his machine was recommissioned for civilian use and the skills he
		developed piloting it became his trade. Now, at the end of a long career, his body is no longer able to withstand the physical strain of piloting it and he is
		forced to retire.
		<br><br>
		He must rely on the old machine to protect him one last time. A life time of living paycheck to paycheck has left him with little savings but if he can sell the mech
		he might be able to get enough money for it to support him through his retirement. He's not the only one who has a history with T57-001s, however. The sole buyer interested 
		in the machine is another veteran from the war, a Zargovian mech-hunter looking for a trophy from her glory days. The kind that hunted him in his youth.
		
		Can he lay the past to rest to secure his future or will he sacrifice what little he has left to hold on to old grudges.
