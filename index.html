		<h2>WHAT IS T57-001?</h2>
		<div class="double-underline"></div>
		<p>T57-001 is an unfinished visual novel prototype made in 2 weeks for the Emotional Mech Jam. It was made by Kirk Musngi, Tyler Rhodes and Eric Schmiel.
		<br><br>
		The game takes place in the aftermath of a devastating period of total warfare. 40 years have passsed and much of the world has moved on. Old enemies have become
		trading partners and cross each others' borders freely. Whole generations have grown up with no living memory of the conflict that tore the world apart. But there
		are still some left that lived through it, and although they have done their best to move on with their children, they still remember.
		<br><br>
		Our story follows an old man who piloted a mech during the conflict. In the post-war years, his machine was recommissioned for civilian use and the skills he
		developed piloting it became his trade. Now, at the end of a long a career, his body is no longer able to withstand the physical strain of piloting it and he is
		forced to retire. It was a hard life with little pay, but even now in the twilight of his days he turns to the old machine that cradled him as a young man against the harsh 
		shrapenel of a wounded world to provide for him as an elder. He can still go on and support himself for a few more years if he sells the old
		hard body to fund his retirement. But he's not the only one with long-forged memories of T57-001s. The sole buyer interested in the machine is an old pilot of the
		Zargovian dive bombers that terrorized him during the war. Can he finally lay the past to rest and go through with the sale so he can afford what's left of his future?
